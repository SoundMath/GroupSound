%--ABSTRACT---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}
Underlying many \ac{dsp} algorithms, in particular those used for digital audio
filters, is the convolution operation, which is a weighted sum of translations
$f(x-y)$. Most classical results of \ac{dsp} are easily and elegantly derived if
we define our functions on $\Z/n\Z$, the abelian group of integers modulo $n$. 
If we replace this underlying ``index set'' with a nonabelian group, then
translation may be written $f(y^{-1}x)$, and the resulting audio filters arising
from convolution naturally produce different effects that those obtained with
ordinary (abelian group) convolution. 

The goal of this project is to explore the idea of using the underlying finite
group (i.e., the index set) as an adjustable parameter of a digital audio
filter. By listening to samples produced using various nonabelian groups, we try
to get a sense of the ``acoustical characters'' of finite groups.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The \emph{translation-invariance} of most classical signal
processing transforms and filtering operations is largely
responsible for their widespread use, and is crucial for
efficient algorithmic implementation and interpretation 
of results~\cite{An:2003}. 

\ac{dsp} on \emph{finite abelian groups} such as $\Z/n\Z$ is
well understood and has great practical utility.  
Translations are defined using addition modulo $n$, and 
basic operations, including convolutions and Fourier 
expansions, are developed relative to these translations~\cite{Tolimieri:1998}. 
%An
%excellent treatment that is applications oriented while
%remaining fairly abstract and general, is provided by 
%%\citeN{Tolimieri:1998}.
%Tolimieri and An in \cite{Tolimieri:1998}.
Recently, however, interest in the practical utility of
\emph{finite nonabelian groups} has grown
significantly. Although the theoretical foundations of
nonabelian groups is well established, application of the
theory to \ac{dsp} has yet to  become common-place.
%; cf.~the NATO
%ASI ``Computational Non-commutative Algebras,'' Italy,
%2003. Another
A notable exception is~\cite{An:2003},
which develops theory and algorithms for
indexing data with nonabelian groups, defining translations
with a non-commutative group multiply operation, and
performing typical \ac{dsp} operations relative to these
translations. 
%The work %of An and Tolimieri 
%demonstrates that including nonabelian groups among the
%possible data indexing strategies significantly broadens the
%range of useful signal processing techniques.

This paper describes the use of nonabelian groups
for indexing one- and two-dimensional signals, and discusses 
some computational advantages and insights that can be gained from 
such an approach. 
A simple but instructive class of 
nonabelian groups 
%-- the \emph{semidirect product} groups --
is examined.  When elements of such
groups are used to index the data, and standard \ac{dsp}
operations are defined with respect to special group
binary operators, more general and interesting
signal transformations are possible.
%=======================================================================
\subsection{Preview: Two Distinctions of Consequence}
Abelian group \ac{dsp} can be completely described in terms of a
special class of signals called the \emph{characters} of the
group. (For $\Z/n\Z$, the characters are simply the exponentials.)
Each character of an abelian group represents a one-dimensional
translation-invariant subspace, and the set of all characters
spans the space of signals indexed by the group; any such
signal can be uniquely expanded as a linear combination over
the characters.

%\pubidadjcol

In contrast, the characters of a nonabelian group $G$ %on the other hand,
do not determine a basis for the space of signals indexed by
$G$.  However, a basis can be constructed by extending the
characters of an abelian subgroup $A$ of $G$, and then taking
certain translations of these extensions.  Some of the
characters of $A$ cannot be extended to characters of $G$,
but only to proper subgroups of $G$.  This presents some
difficulties involving the underlying translation-invariant
subspaces, some of which are now multi-dimensional.
However, it also presents opportunities for alternative
views of local signal domain information on these
translation-invariant subspaces. 

The other abelian/nonabelian distinction of primary importance 
concerns translations defined on the group.  In the abelian group
case, translations represent simple linear shifts in space or time.
When nonabelian groups index the data, however, translations are no
longer so narrowly defined.
