annote={{\bf Abstract:} The classical Fourier transform is one of the most widely used mathematical
                  tools in engineering. However, few engineers know that
                  extensions of harmonic analysis to functions on groups holds
                  great potential for solving problems in robotics, image
                  analysis, mechanics, and other areas. For those that may be
                  aware of its potential value, there is still no place they can
                  turn to for a clear presentation of the background they need
                  to apply the concept to engineering problems. Engineering
                  Applications of Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis brings this
                  powerful tool to the engineering world. Written specifically
                  for engineers and computer scientists, it offers a practical
                  treatment of harmonic analysis in the context of particular
                  Lie groups (rotation and Euclidean motion). It presents only a
                  limited number of proofs, focusing instead on providing a
                  review of the fundamental mathematical results unknown to most
                  engineers and detailed discussions of specific
                  applications.Advances in pure mathematics can lead to very
                  tangible advances in engineering, but only if they are
                  available and accessible to engineers. Engineering
                  Applications of Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis provides the
                  means for adding this valuable and effective technique to the
                  engineer's toolbox.}

annote = {{\bf Abstract:} Abelian group DSP can be completely described in terms of a special class of
                  signals, the characters, defined by their relationship to the
                  translations defined by abelian group multiplication. The  rst
                  problem to be faced in extending classical DSP theory is to
                  decide on what is meant by a translation. We have selected
                  certain classes of nonabelian groups and defined translations
                  in terms of left nonabelian group multiplications. The main
                  distinction between abelian and nonabelian group DSP centers
                  around the problem of character extensions. For abelian groups
                  the solution of the character extension problem is
                  simple. Every character of a subgroup of an abelian group A
                  extends to a character of A. We will see that character
                  extensions lie at the heart of several fast Fourier transform
                  (FFT) algorithms. The nonabelian groups presented in this work
                  will be among the simplest generalizations of abelian
                  groups. A complete description of the DSP of an abelian by
                  abelian semidirect product will be given. For such a group G,
                  there exists an abelian normal subgroup A. A basis for signals
                  indexed by G can be constructed by extending the characters of
                  A and then by forming certain (left-) translations of these
                  characters. The crucial point is that some of these characters
                  of A cannot be extended to characters of G, but only to proper
                  subgroups of G. In contrast to abelian group DSP expansions,
                  expansions in nonabelian group DSP re ect local signal domain
                  information over these proper subgroups. These expansions can
                  be viewed as combined, local image-spectral image domain
                  expansions in analogy to time-frequency expansions. This DSP
                  leads to the definition of a certain class of group filters
                  whose properties will be explored on simulated and recorded
                  images. Through examples we will compare nonabelian group
                  filters with classical abelian group  filters. The main
                  observation is that in contrast to abelian group  filters,
                  nonabelian group  filters can localize in the image domain. This
                  advantage has been used for detecting and localizing the
                  position of geometric objects in image data sets. The works of
                  R. Holmes M. Karpovski and E. Trachtenberg are the basis of
                  much of the research in the application of nonabelian group 
                  harmonic analysis to DSP, especially in the construction of group transforms and
                  group filters. Similar ideas in coding theory have been
                  introduced by F. J. MacWilliams. During the last ten years
                  considerable effort has taken place to extend the range of applicability of nonabelian group
                  methods to the design of new  filters and spectral analysis
                  methodologies, as an image processing tool. Accompanying these
                  application efforts, there has been extensive development of
                  algorithms for computing Fourier transforms over nonabelian
                  groups generalizing the classical FFT. \\

description = {{\bf Abstract:} The translation-invariance of most classical signal processing transforms and
                  filtering operations is largely responsible for their
                  widespread use. Translation-invariance is crucial for
                  interpreting the results of filtering operations and for
                  efficiently implementing these operations. The usual approach
                  in DSP is to define a transform and then show that it is shift
                  or translation invariant. In this work, the translations are
                  viewed as the primary source of classical DSP operations
                  including convolution and Fourier representation. Once this
                  primacy is established, it is reasonable to ask if there are
                  other collections of index set mappings yielding a new DSP and
                  if this new DSP has applications. This text shows that this is
                  the case. 

                  By combining digital signal processing with group harmonic
                  analysis, the authors provide a framework for extending the
                  collection of translations. The specific translations defined
                  in this work through examples and illustrations are
                  sufficiently broad to include many important applications in
                  signal/image processing, biology and physics.  

                  Starting with a complete treatment of abelian group harmonic
                  analysis, this text develops a unifying conceptual basis for
                  both abelian and nonabelian group harmonic
                  analysis. Throughout the text, the common ground in various
                  cases is presented in a common language and format, and
                  emphasizes more clearly and distinctly the differences when
                  they occur. Based on the DSP developed relative to groups,
                  group filters are defined and compared. The main result is
                  that in contrast to abelian group filters, nonabelian group
                  filters localize in the image domain. A detailed account is
                  given to show that expansions over nonabelian group harmonic
                  analysis can be viewed as combined, local image-spectral image
                  domain expansions analogous to time-frequency expansions. 

                  A chapter is devoted to illustrating the use of the
                  localization property for detecting and localizing the
                  position of geometric objects in image data sets by
                  straightforward matched-filtering operation. 

                  The results in this work stand alone in the sense that they
                  are self-contained but it will be an invaluable addition to
                  the larger field of digital signal and image processing.},
