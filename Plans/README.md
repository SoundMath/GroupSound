Short Term Goals and Action Items
---------------------------------

The document [Plans.pdf][] outlines some of our short term goals.  It also contains an Appendix with an excerpt from the original research proposal describing the long term goals of the project.

Also in this directory is this README.md file, which we can use to keep notes and comments about our goals, action items, and overall progress.  However, each specific action item should be submitted as an [issue][].
