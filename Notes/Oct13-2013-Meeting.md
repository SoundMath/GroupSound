Meeting Notes: Oct 13, 2013
===========================

1.  Started Magellan Scholarship application.

2.  Emailed Regi Bain in Music Department about possibly becoming a mentor.

3.  Discussed possible conferences for disseminating results, since travel 
to an international conference would be a big part of the budget.

    a.  AMS JMM: Jan 15--18, 2014, Baltimore USA (Matt cannot attend; William will present)
    b.  ISMA: Jul 7--14, 2014, Le Mans, FR
    c.  ICMC: (not yet advertised)

4.  Completed proposed budget.

5.  Looked at potential audio API and software that might be useful. We looked at PureData (pd) just as a first example of a high-level interfacele to low level sound synthesis and IO.  We might choose to do everything at a more basic low level, especially at the start, and just construct our own waveforms and send them to an output device using, e.g., a Java sound API.  In that case, we don't need pd.  On the other hand, if/when we develop a product, we may want to develop it as a plugin to various existing composition software platforms.

    Another possibility, which we didn't discuss, but would probably be very good for our application, is SuperCollider.  Some SuperCollider links are:
        a.  http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/
        b.  https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider
        c.  http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/super-collision-studio-dave-new-world-supercollider3-part-1

6.  Discussed basics of mathematical theory of DSP underlying project idea.
