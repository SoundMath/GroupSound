%\PARstart{T}{he} translation-invariance of most classical signal
The translation-invariance of most classical signal
processing transforms and filtering operations is largely
responsible for their widespread use, and is crucial for
efficient algorithmic implementation and interpretation 
of results~\cite{An:2003}. 

DSP on \emph{finite abelian groups} such as $\Z/N$ is
well understood and has great practical utility.  
Translations are defined using addition modulo $N$, and 
basic operations, including convolutions and Fourier 
expansions, are developed relative to these translations~\cite{Tolimieri:1998}. 
%An
%excellent treatment that is applications oriented while
%remaining fairly abstract and general, is provided by 
%%\citeN{Tolimieri:1998}.
%Tolimieri and An in \cite{Tolimieri:1998}.
Recently, however, interest in the practical utility of
\emph{finite nonabelian groups} has grown
significantly. Although the theoretical foundations of
nonabelian groups is well established, application of the
theory to DSP has yet to  become common-place.

A notable exception is~\cite{An:2003},
which develops theory and algorithms for
indexing data with nonabelian groups, defining translations
with a non-commutative group multiply operation, and
performing typical DSP operations relative to these
translations. 
%The work %of An and Tolimieri 
%demonstrates that including nonabelian groups among the
%possible data indexing strategies significantly broadens the
%range of useful signal processing techniques.

This paper describes the use of nonabelian groups
for indexing one- and two-dimensional signals, and discusses 
some computational advantages and insights that can be gained from 
such an approach. 
A simple but instructive class of 
nonabelian groups 
%-- the \emph{semidirect product} groups --
is examined.  When elements of such
groups are used to index the data, and standard DSP
operations are defined with respect to special group
binary operators, more general and interesting
signal transformations are possible.
