Underlying most digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms
is the group $\Z/N$ of integers modulo $N$, which is
taken as the data indexing set. Translations are defined
using addition modulo $N$, and DSP operations, including
convolutions and Fourier expansions, are then developed
relative to these translations. Recently, An and
Tolimieri~\cite{An:2003} considered a different class of
index set mappings, which arise when the underlying group is
nonabelian, and successfully apply them to 2D image data. 

The present work provides an overview of harmonic analysis on finite
groups and group algebras. 
%I present the basic nonabelian group theory relevant to DSP, and define 
``Generalized translation,'' and its consequence, ``generalized
convolution'' are defined.  Thereafter, some concrete and simple, yet revealing,
examples of nonabelian-group indexing sets  
are discussed along with their practical DSP implications.
%Numerical results are provided along with the
%Matlab source code for reproducing them.
