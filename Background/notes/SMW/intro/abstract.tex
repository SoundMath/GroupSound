This paper describes new and existing methods for representing,
analyzing, and modifying the information content of musical signals.
In particular, the primary objective is to find signal representations
well suited for the analysis and understanding of the human perception
of music.  In pursuit of this objective, we consider how to use such
representations to make inferences about a listener's musical preferences
concerning the represented signal.  We also consider ways in which special
signal representations can facilitate signal modifications accroding to
given musical criteria.
