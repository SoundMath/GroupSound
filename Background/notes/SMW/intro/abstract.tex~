This paper describes existing and new methods for representing,
analyzing, and modifying the information content of musical signals.
In particular, the primary objective is to find signal representations
well suited for the analysis and understanding of the human perception
of music.  In pursuit of this objective, we consider how such
representations can be used to make inferences about a listener's
musical preferences concerning the represented signal.  We also
consider ways in which special signal representations can facilitate
modification of musical signals based on the information they provide.
